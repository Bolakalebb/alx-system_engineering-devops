### Tasks

## 0. Install MySQL
First things first, letâ€™s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

* MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x
* Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
* Please make sure you have your README.md pushed to GitHub.
Example:

ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.25, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$
